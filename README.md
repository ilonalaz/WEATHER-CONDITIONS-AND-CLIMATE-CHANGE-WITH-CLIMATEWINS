# WEATHER-CONDITIONS-AND-CLIMATE-CHANGE-WITH-CLIMATEWINS
In this project, I use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change.

## Project Background
ClimateWins wants to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe. Itâ€™s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the past 10 to 20 years. 
However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning.
With data from the past century, it hopes to create a model for what the future will hold.

### Here are the questions it wants to answer first:
1. How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
2. ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine
learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?
3. Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather
conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so, it could also
be possible to predict danger.)

## Data
Our data set is based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe, which contain data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022. Recordings exist for almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more. This data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project.
